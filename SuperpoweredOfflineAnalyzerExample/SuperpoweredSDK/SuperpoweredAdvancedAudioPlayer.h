/**
 @brief High performance advanced audio player with:
 
 - time-stretching and pitch shifting,
 
 - beat and tempo sync,
 
 - scratching,
 
 - tempo bend,
 
 - looping,
 
 - slip mode,
 
 - fast seeking (cached points),
 
 - momentum and jog wheel handling,
 
 - 0 latency, real-time operation,
 
 - low memory usage (5300 kb plus 200 kb for every cached point),
 
 - thread safety (all methods are thread-safe),
 
 - direct iPod music library access.
 
 Can not be used for offline processing. Supported file types:
 - Stereo or mono pcm WAV and AIFF (16-bit int, 24-bit int, 32-bit int or 32-bit IEEE float).
 - MP3 (all kind).
 - AAC-LC in M4A container (iTunes).
 - AAC-LC in ADTS container (.aac).
 - Apple Lossless (on iOS only).
 - Http Live Streaming (HLS): vod/live/event streams, AAC-LC/MP3 in audio files or MPEG-TS files. Support for byte ranges and AES-128 encryption.
 
 @param positionMs The current position. Always accurate, no matter of time-stretching and other transformations. Read only.
 @param positionPercent The current position as a percentage (0.0f to 1.0f). Read only.
 @param positionSeconds The current position as seconds elapsed. Read only.
 @param durationMs The duration of the current track in milliseconds. Equals to UINT_MAX for live streams. Read only.
 @param durationSeconds The duration of the current track in seconds. Equals to UINT_MAX for live streams. Read only.
 @param waitingForBuffering Indicates if the player waits for audio data to be bufferred. Read only.
 @param playing Indicates if the player is playing or paused. Read only.
 @param tempo The current tempo. Read only.
 @param masterTempo Time-stretching is enabled or not. Read only.
 @param pitchShift Note offset from -12 to 12. 0 means no pitch shift. Read only.
 @param pitchShiftCents Pitch shift cents, from -1200 (one octave down) to 1200 (one octave up). 0 means no pitch shift. Read only.
 @param bpm Must be correct for syncing. There is no auto-bpm detection inside. Read only.
 @param currentBpm The actual bpm of the track (as bpm changes with the current tempo). Read only.
 @param slip If enabled, scratching or reverse will maintain the playback position as if you had never entered those modes. Read only.
 @param scratching The player is in scratching mode or not. Read only.
 @param reverse Indicates if the playback goes backwards. Read only.
 @param looping Indicates if looping is enabled. Read only.
 @param firstBeatMs Tells where the first beat (the beatgrid) begins. Must be correct for syncing. Read only.
 @param msElapsedSinceLastBeat How many milliseconds elapsed since the last beat. Read only.
 @param beatIndex Which beat has just happened (1 [1.0f-1.999f], 2 [2.0f-2.999f], 3 [3.0f-3.99f], 4 [4.0f-4.99f]). A value of 0 means "don't know". Read only.
 @param bufferStartPercent What is buffered from the original source, start point. Will always be 0 for non-network sources (files). Read only.
 @param bufferEndPercent What is buffered from the original source, end point. Will always be 1.0f for non-network sources (files). Read only.
 @param currentBps The current download speed.
 @param syncMode The current sync mode (off, tempo, or tempo and beat).
 @param fixDoubleOrHalfBPM If tempo is >1.4f or <0.6f, it will treat the bpm as half or double. Good for certain genres. False by default.
 @param waitForNextBeatWithBeatSync Wait for the next beat if beat-syncing is enabled. False by default.
 @param dynamicHLSAlternativeSwitching Dynamicly changing the current HLS alternative to match the available network bandwidth. Default is true.
 @param reverseToForwardAtLoopStart If looping and playback direction is reverse, reaching the beginning of the loop will change direction to forward. True by default.
 @param downloadSecondsAhead The HLS content download strategy: how many seconds ahead of the playback position to download. Default is HLS_DOWNLOAD_REMAINING, meaning it will download everything after the playback position, until the end. HLS_DOWNLOAD_EVERYTHING downloads before the playback position too.
 @param maxDownloadAttempts If HLS download fails, how many times to try until sleep. Default: 100. After sleep, NetworkError is called continously.
 @param minTimeStretchingTempo Will not time-stretch, just resample below this tempo. Default: 0.501f (recommended value for low CPU on older mobile devices, such as the first iPad). Set this before an open() call. 
 @param maxTimeStretchingTempo Will not time-stretch, just resample above this tempo. Default: 2.0f (recommended value for low CPU on older mobile devices, such as the first iPad).
