 @brief This is the prototype of an audio processing callback function.

 If the application requires both audio input and audio output, this callback is called once (there is no separate audio input and audio output callback). Audio input is available in audioIO, and the application should change it's contents for audio output.

 @param clientdata A custom pointer your callback receives.
 @param audioIO 16-bit stereo interleaved audio input and/or output.
 @param numberOfSamples The number of samples received and/or requested.
 @param samplerate The current sample rate in Hz.

 @param callback The audio processing callback function to call periodically.
 @param clientdata A custom pointer the callback receives.
