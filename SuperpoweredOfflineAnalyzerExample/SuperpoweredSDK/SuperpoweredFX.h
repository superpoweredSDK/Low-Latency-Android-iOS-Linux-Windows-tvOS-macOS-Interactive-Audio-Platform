 \mainpage Superpowered Audio SDK
 
 The Superpowered Audio SDK is a software development kit based on Superpowered Incâ€™s digital signal processing (DSP) technology.

 Superpowered technology allows developers to build computationally intensive audio apps and embedded applications that process more quickly and use less power than other comparable solutions.

 Superpowered DSP is designed and optimized, from scratch, to run on low-power mobile processors. Specifically, any device running ARM with the NEON extension (which covers 99% of all mobile devices manufactured). Intel CPU is supported too.
 
 Details of the latest version can be found at http://superpowered.com/superpowered-audio-sdk/
